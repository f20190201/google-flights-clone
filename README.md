## Mock Data System

This application uses a comprehensive mock data system that generates realistic flight data:

### Features
- **14+ Airlines**: Air India, IndiGo, British Airways, Lufthansa, Delta, American Airlines, etc.
- **Major Airports**: BBI, BLR, DEL, BOM, JFK, LAX, LHR, CDG, DUB, FRA
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Realistic price generation based on airline, time, and stops
- **Emissions Data**: CO2 emissions with percentage comparisons (80-280 kg CO2e)
- **Flight Variations**: Mix of nonstop and connecting flights (0-2 stops)
- **Round Trip Support**: Automatic return flight generation

### Data Generation Logic

The mock service (`src/services/mockFlightService.js`) generates:

```javascript
// Realistic flight characteristics
- Flight duration: 2-10 hours based on route and stops
- Departure times: Random 24-hour distribution
- Price factors: Airline prestige, departure time, stops
- Emissions: Realistic CO2 calculations with categories
- Flight numbers: Realistic 4-digit flight numbers
```

### Real API Integration (Optional)

To integrate with real flight data:
1. Install axios: `npm install axios`
2. Get API key from [RapidAPI Sky Scrapper](https://rapidapi.com/3b-data-3b-data-default/api/sky-scrapper)
3. Replace `searchMockFlights` calls with real API service

## Usage Guide

### Searching for Flights

1. **Select Trip Type**: Choose Round trip, One way, or Multi-city
2. **Enter Airports**: Use the autocomplete to search and select origin/destination
3. **Choose Dates**: Select departure date (and return date for round trips)
4. **Set Passengers & Class**: Configure traveler count and cabin class
5. **Search**: Click "Search Flights" to find available flights

### Viewing Results

- **Expandable Details**: Click "Flight Details" to see complete flight segments
- **URL Persistence**: Results page URL contains all search parameters
- **Navigation**: Use browser back button or header logo to return to search

### URL Structure

Search parameters are preserved in the URL for easy sharing and bookmarking:

```
/results?tripType=roundtrip&originSkyId=NYCA&destinationSkyId=LOND&departureDate=2024-07-01&returnDate=2024-07-08&adults=1&cabinClass=economy
```
